**Location:** New York City; Washington, DC; or a remote/home office anywhere in the United States 

**Type of Vacancy:** Salaried full-time, starting March 2019  

**Reports to:** Senior Managing Director of Partnerships

**Travel Required:** 20-40% depending on season

**Compensation:** Commensurate with experience 

**Summary of Position**

Teaching Lab is seeking a Director of Sitework (DoS) to join our Partnerships Team and lead a portfolio of engagements with school systems as they implement EL Education’s ELA curriculum (including both EL 1.0 in grades 6-8 and EL 2.0 in grades K-5) using our model for professional learning. 

Specifically, the DoS will engage in three major workstreams:

1. Build and maintain high-level district relationships, ensuring that districts build institutional knowledge of research-based professional learning practices and the EL curriculum in a way that supports independent implementation of Teaching Lab’s model over time.
2. Support and develop a cohort of Project Managers as they lead day-to-day implementation of Teaching Lab’s work in each community, including support and coaching on facilitation, knowledge of the EL curriculum, data collection, client investment, and project planning.  
3. Collaborate with other members of the Teaching Lab community, including our professional learning content design team, our business and operations team, our impact and evaluation team, and external stakeholders like EL Education and other professional learning organizations, to ensure success for our school system partners and the students they serve. 

As a rapidly growing nonprofit, we seek an entrepreneurial individual excited about leading a team. This position has high potential for both large-scale impact and career growth.

Eligible candidates must have strong expertise in relationship and client management, leading professional learning, project planning, the EL curriculum, and the Common Core or similar College- and Career-Ready state standards. Ideal candidates will have the unique combination of intellectual curiosity and established skill in each of these areas. Above all, any candidate must have a demonstrated commitment to educational equity.

**Key Responsibilities & Workstreams**

Build & Maintain High-Level District Relationships. The DoS will:

* Engage with high-level leadership in client school systems, including superintendents, chief academic officers, curriculum and instruction experts, and principals, to build their knowledge of research-based professional learning practices, Teaching Lab’s professional learning model, and the EL curriculum
* Support district leaders by scoping, proposing, and leading multi-year efforts to create sustainable, research-based, district-led professional learning that lead to self-sustaining professional learning communities 
* Work with Teaching Lab’s Partnerships Team to identify and engage new school system clients on scopes of work to meet business development goals and drive towards impact and outcomes for teachers and students

Support & Develop Project Managers and Facilitators. The DoS will:

* Lead high-level project management across Teaching Lab’s portfolio of EL projects 
* Build a strong team culture with Project Managers and Facilitators in the EL portfolio 
* Train Project Managers and Facilitators on professional learning best practices, facilitation and client engagement techniques, and Teaching Lab’s EL professional learning sequence
* Coach project managers through an inquiry process aimed at developing their practice
* Support Project Managers as they lead day-to-day implementation of the work in partner sites 

Collaborate With Other Teams. The DoS will:

* Engage with Teaching Lab’s content development team to support development and iteration on EL-specific professional learning content modules and sequences, including maintaining site-specific versions of that content   
* Support Teaching Lab’s data collection and impact evaluation processes in conjunction with the Research and Learning team
* Work with Teaching Lab’s Business and Operations team to support project management, staffing, performance management, and financial goals
* Liaise with external stakeholders, including EL Education and other experts in the field, to ensure continued success of Teaching Lab’s work with school systems

**Areas for Growth**

* Opportunities to attend and present at conferences
* A peer community of other Directors of Sitework focused on collaborating and supporting each other in their core areas of responsibility 
* Internal cycles of inquiry on core topics that mirror our client-facing, external professional learning sequences

In addition, Teaching Lab is a fast-growing nonprofit organization; we expect to double in size annually for the next several years, which will provide pathways for career growth and expanded impact over time.
