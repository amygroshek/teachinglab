_Summary of Position_

Teaching Lab is seeking a Director of Math Content Design to support our new work with math curricula and create curriculum-specific professional learning content modules to support teacher-led cycles of inquiry. This work will initially focus on the Illustrative Mathematics curriculum but may expand to additional standards-aligned curricula over time.

The Director of Math Content Design will drive towards an understanding of three essential questions for Teaching Lab:

1. How will Teaching Lab adopt its model to mathematics more and what changes will need to be made? How will cycles of inquiry target components of Common Core-aligned mathematics instruction? 
2. How will Teaching Lab build upon the Illustrative Math (or similar standards-aligned) curriculum to create engaging, high-impact professional learning experiences for teachers?
3. How will Teaching Lab increasingly incorporate the “heart” component into professional learning design over time? 

The Director of Math Content Design will also be involved in supporting facilitation and/or leading professional development sessions. The role may, depending on the interest of the candidate, also include some client support and/or business development efforts. 

Eligible candidates must have deep expertise in teaching, professional learning, curriculum, and the Common Core State Standards in the content area of mathematics. Ideal candidates will have the unique combination of intellectual depth and skill in managing teams and projects. Above all, any candidate must have a demonstrated commitment to educational equity.

The Director of Math will be a key member of the organization’s program team, tasked with implementing and iterating on the organization’s core program. As a rapidly growing nonprofit, we seek an entrepreneurial team member excited about building a team and an organization from the ground up. This position has high potential for both large-scale impact and career growth as Teaching Lab scales.
