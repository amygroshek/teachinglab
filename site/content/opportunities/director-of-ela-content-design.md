---
**Type of Vacancy:** Salaried full-time, starting March 2019  

**Location:** New York City; Washington, DC; or a remote/home office anywhere in the United States 

**Reports to:** Managing Director of Content Design

**Travel Required:** 15-20% depending on season

**Compensation:** Commensurate with experience 

**Summary of Position**

Teaching Lab is seeking a Director of ELA Content Design to support our continued work in ELA and to create curriculum-specific professional learning content modules to support teacher-led cycles of inquiry. This work will focus on EL Education’s K-5 and 6-8 ELA curriculum and Guidebooks 2.0 but may expand to additional highly-reviewed, standards-aligned curricula over time.

The Director of ELA Content Design will drive towards an understanding of three essential questions for Teaching Lab:

1. How will cycles of inquiry target components of Common Core-aligned ELA instruction? How will other aligned support be designed to support the Lab model and HQ implementation of ELA instructional materials?
2. How will Teaching Lab build upon the standards-aligned curriculum to create engaging, high-impact professional learning experiences for teachers?
3. How will Teaching Lab increasingly incorporate the “heart” component into professional learning design over time? 

The Director of ELA Content Design will also be involved in supporting facilitation and/or leading professional development sessions. The role may, depending on the interest of the candidate, also include some client support and/or business development efforts. 

Eligible candidates must have deep expertise in teaching, professional learning, curriculum, and the Common Core or other College- and Career-Ready standards in the content area of English Language Arts. Ideal candidates will have the unique combination of intellectual depth and skill in managing teams and projects. Above all, any candidate must have a demonstrated commitment to educational equity.

The Director of ELA Content Design will be a key member of the organization’s program team, tasked with implementing and iterating on the organization’s core program. As a rapidly growing nonprofit, we seek an entrepreneurial team member excited about building a team and an organization from the ground up. This position has high potential for both large-scale impact and career growth as Teaching Lab scales.
