**Summary of Position**

Teaching Lab is seeking a Director of People Operations and Development (D-POD) to support our growing team of passionate educators. The D-POD will work closely with the Chief Operating Officer to support Teaching Lab’s 30+ staff members by:

1. Developing and managing a comprehensive human capital pipeline, including recruitment, selection, onboarding, and retention
2. Developing and leading staff development efforts, including a formal performance management system, a formal staff development system, and informal development opportunities 
3. Supporting and developing formal and informal culture across the organization in conjunction with Teaching Lab’s leadership team, including efforts around diversity, equity, and inclusion
4. Leading human capital operations, including payroll, compliance, handbooks, etc.
5. Leading or supporting organization-wide efforts to research and systematize compensation, benefits, staffing projections, project assignments, and other elements of a growing organization 

The D-POD will also be a key member of the organization’s operations team, working in conjunction with team members who manage finance, operations, communications, philanthropy, business strategy, and other core workstreams. 

This role affords the possibility of working on both an operational level and helping to develop and set strategy for a growing organization, and is an ideal role for someone who is looking to broaden their skillsets and take on new challenges outside of their current, core workstreams. Teaching Lab is a fast-growing nonprofit organization; we expect to double in size annually for the next several years, which will provide pathways for career growth and expanded impact over time.

Eligible candidates must have deep expertise in human capital management, including many, if not all, of the above workstreams. Ideal candidates will have the unique combination of intellectual depth and skill in managing teams and projects. Above all, any candidate must demonstrate interest and alignment with Teaching Lab’s mission to end educational inequity.
