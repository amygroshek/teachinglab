      Adrienne Williams brings 8-years of teaching, coaching, and leading
      experience with Center City Public Charter Schools in Washington, DC.
      There, Adrienne served as a teacher-leader and curriculum manager
      supporting instruction in literacy and math in grades K-3. In 2016, she
      won the Center City Excellence Award for achieving the highest student
      performance in reading with 85% at or above grade level,  70% being
      advanced. Outside of her charter-based worked, Adrienne has promoted and
      provided professional learning and collaboration around literacy
      instruction and standards alignment in both the District and around the
      country. She came to education through Urban Teacherâ€™s four-year program
      and completed a Teaching Lab fellowship that gave her firsthand knowledge
      of the potential of putting the power of change in the hands of teachers.
    quote: >-
      As a first-grade teacher and later a coach, my relationships with my peers
      were integral to improving my practice. Through sharing ideas, lesson
      plans, student work and practicing together, I was able to get better
      faster. Not only did my practice improve, but my relationships with my
      colleagues helped get me through the challenging first years of being a
      teacher. They helped build my resilience to stay in the game and keep
      showing up for my kids when it would have been easy to burn out. Having a
      team to support you and stay focused on the right work was crucial.
