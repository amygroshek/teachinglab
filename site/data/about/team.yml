      experience with Center City Public Charter Schools in Washington, DC.
      There, Adrienne served as a teacher-leader and curriculum manager
      supporting instruction in literacy and math in grades K-3. In 2016, she
      won the Center City Excellence Award for achieving the highest student
      performance in reading with 85% at or above grade level,  70% being

      instruction and standards alignment in both the District and around the
      country. She came to education through Urban Teacherâ€™s four-year program
      and completed a Teaching Lab fellowship that gave her firsthand knowledge
      of the potential of putting the power of change in the hands of teachers.

      As a first-grade teacher and later a coach, my relationships with my peers
      were integral to improving my practice. Through sharing ideas, lesson
      plans, student work and practicing together, I was able to get better
      faster. Not only did my practice improve, but my relationships with my
      colleagues helped get me through the challenging first years of being a
      teacher. They helped build my resilience to stay in the game and keep
      showing up for my kids when it would have been easy to burn out. Having a
      team to support you and stay focused on the right work was crucial.
