      As a middle school math teacher in Washington DC, I was lucky enough to be
      part of a teacher-led community focused on improving our instruction. It
      worked! To this day, my middle school math students hold the citywide
      record for highest math test scores. This form of collaboration works and
      if we can engage more educators in these conversations, we can change our
      profession.
