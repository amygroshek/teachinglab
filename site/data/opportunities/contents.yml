      **Location:** Flexible (continental U.S.)


      **Type of Vacancy:** Full-Time


      **Travel required:** 20-30%, depending on time of year




      **Summary of Position**


      The Managing Director of Learning and Research (MD-LR) will oversee all of
      Teaching Lab’s internal data and learning strategy as well as be the
      organization’s point person for external research and learning. The MD-LR
      will also develop Teaching Lab into a learning organization committed to
      an iterative and adaptive approach to continuous improvement. As Teaching
      Lab has expanded, our sitework has grown significantly, now covering more
      than 16 different locations across the United States, including two
      state-level contracts and several school districts, charter management
      organizations, and other networks of schools. While many of our team
      members are focused on providing key services and ensuring success in
      those sites, we do not yet have a comprehensive approach to learning from
      that sitework and using insights to iterate on our professional learning
      model. 


      The MD-LR will design and implement a comprehensive learning strategy,
      including design and creation of a data system, to drive towards learning
      in the following areas:


      **1. Performance management.** Teaching Lab’s team members (both full-time
      and part-time) are at the core of the organization’s work, and management
      of staff performance is an essential driver of quality of services.
      Teaching Lab has facilitators in the field, content developers, and staff
      responsible for strategy and operations. A large part of the work of
      learning and continuous improvement will be around creating systems to
      understand key drivers of team member and professional learning
      facilitator performance and identifying how to best support and develop
      people across the organization. 


      **2. Continuous programmatic improvement.** Research literature highlights
      critical programmatic components for high-quality professional learning;
      however, the research base does not support professional learning
      organizations to come to clear conclusions about two major components of
      their programs: first, identification of the best mix of programmatic
      components that will lead towards the greatest impact (e.g., Which
      professional learning system components should be standardized and which
      should differ by local context?) and second, an understanding of the
      critical enabling conditions for service models to achieve impact (e.g.,
      What agreements should be in place with district leaders? What kinds of
      teacher-leadership structures might enable a new professional learning
      model to sustain itself? What is the optimal length of engagement with a
      school district?). Both questions will be critical learning areas as
      Teaching Lab begins investigating its own practice.


      **3. Evidence of impact.** Teaching Lab will use its own sitework to
      identify leading indicators of impact and tools to measure them (e.g.,
      teacher buy-in metrics through surveys), use those leading indicators and
      tools to adjust programmatic components in short cycles of learning (e.g.,
      increase or decrease the number of touchpoints for teachers or support
      days for school leaders), and understand how those leading indicators are
      linked to lagging indicators of impact on teacher practice and student
      achievement. 


      In addition to the above internal research and learning agenda, the MD-LR
      will also be responsible for staying abreast of key research in the field,
      attending conferences, conducting site visits, and working with peer
      organizations to ensure a comprehensive understanding of professional
      learning trends and evidence. 


      At the core of Teaching Lab’s theory of action is a desire to influence
      other professional learning organizations. To that end, the above research
      agenda—and the MD-LR—will drive towards an understanding of two essential
      questions for Teaching Lab and all professional learning organizations:


      **1. Scale:** How do programs maintain programmatic quality while scaling
      to more state, district, and school partners? How do programs continuously
      learn and improve while scaling to different contexts (i.e., what should
      be standardized; what should be context-dependent)? 


      **2. Sustainability:** How do professional learning organizations ensure
      sustainability of their program and their impact? What enabling conditions
      must be in place in states and districts to ensure sustainability of
      teacher professional learning post-engagement?


      The MD-LR will be a key member of the organization’s program team, tasked
      with implementing and iterating on the organization’s core program.
